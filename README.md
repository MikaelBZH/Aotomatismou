# Math Automatisms Practice Generator

This project provides a set of HTML, CSS and JavaScript pages designed to help middle school students practice basic math automatisms (mental calculation, repetition, fluency).

It is primarily intended as a **flexible pedagogical tool** that teachers can adapt to their own teaching practices and classroom needs.

## Target audience

- Middle school teachers
- Students
- Parents
- Educators working in non-commercial contexts

---

## Educational intent

This project was created to:
- support daily practice of math automatisms
- allow repetition with variation
- offer a lightweight alternative to closed educational platforms

The code is intentionally kept **simple and readable**, so that teachers with basic web knowledge can understand, modify, and extend it.

## Adapting the code for your teaching

Teachers are explicitly encouraged to:

- Modify the exercises (difficulty, numbers, operations)
- Adapt the interface (layout, colors, fonts, wording)
- Translate or rewrite instructions
- Add or remove exercise types
- Use the project locally, on a school server, or via an internal educational platform

Typical non-commercial uses include:
- Classroom activities
- Homework support
- School intranet / ENT
- Sharing adapted versions with colleagues or students

As long as the use remains **non-commercial**, no additional permission is required.

## Technical overview

- HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- Uses MathJax for mathematical notation rendering
- No build tools or frameworks required
- Runs in any modern web browser

Depending on how MathJax is loaded:
- the project can be used **offline** if MathJax is installed locally
- or requires an **internet connection** if MathJax is loaded from a CDN
